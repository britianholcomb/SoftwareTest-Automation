**How Can I Ensure My Code, Program, or Software is Functional and Secure?**  
To make sure my code works well and is safe, I test it thoroughly using different types of tests, like unit tests (for small pieces) and integration tests (to see how parts work together). I also write clear and organized code, check for errors, and fix them early. For security, I make sure user input is safe, encrypt sensitive data, and limit access to important parts of the program. I also use tools to find security issues and review the code regularly to catch problems.

**How Do I Interpret User Needs and Incorporate Them Into a Program?**  
I learn what users need by talking to them, using surveys, or watching how they use similar programs. I create "user stories" to understand their goals and challenges better. Once I know what they need, I focus on building features that solve their problems and make the program easy to use. I also test the program with users and make changes based on their feedback to ensure it works for them.

**How Do I Approach Designing Software?**  
When I design software, I start by understanding the problem it’s supposed to solve. I create simple diagrams or flowcharts to plan how the program will work. I focus on making the software flexible so it’s easy to update later and choose tools or frameworks that fit the project. I also work with others to make sure the design makes sense and improve it based on feedback.
